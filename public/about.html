<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I was born and raised in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Trained in the prestigious
  Uzbek College of Choreography under Kurkmas Sagatov and the State Academy
  Bolshoi Theatre of Opera and Ballet under Germen Janson, I went on to enjoy an
  international dance career which brought me to the United States at age 29. I
  didn't know it at the time, but learning English by watching TV and listening
  to talk shows on public radio would later prove I could learn anything if I
  immersed myself in it.

  At some point coding caught my attention. As with learning English, I began to
  immerse myself in HTML, CSS, JS and Python. Now, I am gaining fluency in these
  languages of computer science. I am starting to consider where I can apply the
  wisdom gained from growing up in the USSR, making a new life in the US,
  leveraging my fluency in Russian and English along with my growing skill as a
  developer.
